# OASIS
Open Automation Scientific Information System

This is a project to compile lots of different scientific experimental automation protocols all in one place. The idea is that scientists who know how to program and automate experiments will share their easy to use and modifiable code for others to take advantage of and use in new ways. Currently it is only being maintained by Brison Cowan, a PhD student in Radiochemistry at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

The vision for this tool will be a large database of experimental protocols that those who don't know how to program can take advantage of for extremely replicable studies across disciplines. Because this is the vision good documentation of the work is absolutely vital. No one will use it if it isn't easy to pick up.
