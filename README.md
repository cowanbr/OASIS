# OASIS
## Open Automation Scientific Information System

OASIS is a database of a wide range of scientific automation protocols, all kept in one place with easy to understand documentation. No programming experience necessary. The goal of OASIS is to allow scientists who are experienced in automation to share their easy-to-use, versatile, modifiable, and well documented code with the rest of the scientific community. 

Currently, OASIS is being maintained and created by Brison Cowan, a PhD student in Radiochemistry at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

## Vision

**If it isn't easy to use, it won't be used.**

The ultimate vision for OASIS is a large and comprehensive database of automation protocols that are used and modified across disciplines, including by those who have limited experience with coding and automation. This is all with a focus on replicability of and accessibility. Anyone and everyone should be able to use and modify the protocols with ease.

The vision relies on good documentation. Again, if it isn't easy to use, it won't be used.

## Features

This is an open access (GPL 3.0 license) repository. That means anyone can access, use, and contribute to the protocols. Community contributions are invaluable to the project. The larger that OASIS grows the more useful it will be to everyone.

A core tenant of this project wil be focusing on making everything user-friendly. It should be simple enough for undergraduates and researchers who have never seen a line of code before to make some use of. The protocols will of course still be robust, but clearly documented code and ease of use are paramount. The aim is to lower the barrier of entry for extremely replicable automated scientific work.
